# Personal Resume Website

![alt text](https://github.com/yipmunallen/First-Milestone-Project/blob/master/assets/images/websitescreenshot.png "Website Screenshot")

This is a static (front-end) personal resume website for Yip Mun Allen, the creator of the site. It is designed to be a creative way for prospective recruiters to find out more about the website owner. 
The responsive nature of the site means that it can be read on all media devices and a single-page design was chosen in order to make it easy to quickly jump 
to the sections that the recruiter may be interested in without the need for opening new pages.

## UX

The primary target audience is recruiters who will use the site to find out more information about the website owner and potentially contact them with a job opportunity. The website was created to be intuitive and provide easy access to any information the recruiters may be looking for.

 ### Users Stories
As a recruiter I want to:

1. Get all of the information I'm looking for quickly and easily as there will be lots of potential applicants.
1. Find out more about the creator's work experience to see if they have the correct qualifications for a role.
1. Clearly see what the creator's skills are in order to match them to a suitable role.
1. Have access to a CV that can be saved offline.
1. Be able to contact the creator with potential opportunities.

- #### List of Sections 

  -  __About__ -
Provides some basic information about the site owner along with a summary written to introduce them.

  - __Experience__ -
Gives an overview of the owner's work experience and education history.

  - __Skills__ -
Highlights some of the core skill of the site owner that recruiters may be looking out for.

  - __Projects__ -
Designed to show certain projects that the website owner has worked on. Text giving a summary of the project is paired with an image / screenshot of the project. 
Both the image and text are links to the website/project that is being described. 

  - __Contact__ -
Contains a form that allows users to quickly and easily contact the site owner without having to navigate away from the page.

-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The two main colours used are white and turqoise. This scheme complements the colours within the hero image and is used to differentiate between the sections, maybe them easy to identify as you scroll down the page.

 -   #### Typography
      -   The main font used throughout the site is Noto San JP. Roboto is also used for the section headings and the name in the hero section as well as the navbar. Sans-serif has been used as the fallback font throughout. These fonts are chosen as they are easy to read and appropriate for a professional look.

- #### Menu Bar

   - The menu bar at the top of the page makes it easy for users to quickly jump to the sections of the page that they are interested it. The bar has been made "sticky" so it is accessible wherever the user is on the page, and the "Download CV" button in the bar means that the call to action follows the user down the page.



## Technologies Used
